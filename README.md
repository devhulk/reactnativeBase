## React Native Minimalist Base Project

# Intro

You still need to follow intructions for both IOS and Android found [here](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html)

Once you have the proper tools setup for Xcode and Android studio you will be good to go.

```
git clone https://github.com/devhulk/reactnativeBase.git
mv reactnativeBase yourProjectName
cd yourProjectName
npm i
```
Make sure for Android your AVD is running.
Then run IOS and Android
```
cd yourProjectName
react-native run-ios
react-native run-android
```
